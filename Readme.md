# LRC Calculator Package

This folder contains a series of scripts and functions used for estimating deep Littlewood-Richardsom coefficients. The code is largely self-documenting.

For theoretical insight, see the following paper (in publication) https://doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2018.1473822. See also AWCompilationPrePrint.pdf for an open draft.

The _Test.m files are used to launch the functions with user defined inputs. The _C or _Cousins files use the continuum volume estimation algorithm from Ben Cousins, while the other files use a lattice random walk. _Accuracy or _Timing scripts were used to generate comparative data between the algorithms.

The MFE_version folder is required to be included on the matlab active path.

This code is available for academic and personal usage and modification for any open project with appropriate attribution to the original author, John Lombard, through citation of the above paper. The work of other authors noted within (and accompanied by their respective licences) is seperately handled.

This code may not be maintained regularly and does not guarantee correctness, but is provided in the interest of an open-science initiative and to provide a snapshot of current field research.
