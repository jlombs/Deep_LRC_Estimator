# LRC Exact Calculator

This folder contains a series of bash scripts and matlab functions used to generate a list of exact LRCs to be used in the LRC_Calculator comparison tests. The code is largely self-documenting.

The bash scripts take user defined weight vectors of a given length, and output the exact LRCs associated with certain multiples of those weights. The data is saved to text files.

fitData.m and its test script were used to study non-negative polynomial fitting on the curves generated by the weight multiples.
